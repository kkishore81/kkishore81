Hi, I'm Kaushal Kishore, and I am working as a chief manager in  Bank of Baroda since 2010. I have a keen interest in exploring the world of data science and AI to develop innovative functionalities relevant to the banking industry. Currently, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge in data science.

I am enthusiastic about collaborating on banking projects that aim to solve real banking issues, such as predicting Non-Performing Assets (NPA) based on a firm's historical financial records. I am open to partnering with finance or banking fintech companies where I can leverage my banking experience alongside cutting-edge technology.
